They are essentially vectors that indicate the direction and magnitude of motion. Instead of storing the entire content of each frame, video compression algorithms exploit the temporal redundancy between frames by encoding only the changes or differences between them.

This means that consecutive frames are often very similar, with only small changes due to object motion or camera movement. Instead of storing the entire information for each frame, motion vectors are used to predict the content of a frame based on the previous frame and the motion information.\n",
