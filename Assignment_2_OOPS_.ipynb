        "Security:\n",
        "\n",
        "Access Control: Encapsulation provides a mechanism for controlling access to the internal state of an object. By using access modifiers (public, private, protected), developers can define which parts of a class are accessible from outside and which should remain private.\n",

        "Data Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details, limiting direct access to the internal state of an object. This reduces the risk of unintentional modifications or unauthorized access.\n",

        "Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementation Changes: Encapsulation allows for changes to the internal implementation without affecting external code. This flexibility is crucial for adapting the code to evolving requirements or fixing issues without disrupting existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interface Stability: The public interface of a class (exposed through methods) can remain stable even if the internal implementation changes. This stability simplifies maintenance for external code relying on the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: Encapsulation facilitates code reuse by encapsulating functionalities into classes. These classes can be reused in different parts of the codebase or even in other projects, promoting a modular and reusable design.\n",

        "Access to the internal state of an object is provided through controlled interfaces, typically implemented using getter and setter methods. These methods allow external code to retrieve or modify the internal attributes in a controlled manner.\n",

        "Encapsulation of Behavior:\n",

        "Information hiding allows developers to create abstractions that simplify the understanding of a system. Users of a class or module don't need to be concerned with the intricate details of how things are implemented; they interact with a simplified and abstracted interface.\n",

        "Modularity and Independence:\n",

        "Information hiding promotes modularity by allowing the development of independent components. Changes to the internal implementation of one module do not affect other modules as long as the public interfaces remain consistent.\n",

        "Ease of Maintenance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Information hiding localizes changes, making the codebase more maintainable. Modifications can be made within the boundaries of a class or module without affecting other parts of the system. This isolation simplifies debugging and maintenance.\n",

        "Security and Integrity:\n",

        "Information hiding enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. It ensures that modifications to the internal state occur through controlled and validated interfaces, reducing the risk of unintended or malicious changes.\n",

ADTs focus on the behavior of the data type rather than its internal details, providing a way to abstract and encapsulate data and operations. The goal is to separate the interface (what operations can be performed) from the implementation (how those operations are carried out).\n",

        "The concept of \"has-a\" relationships in composition refers to the association between classes where one class contains an instance of another class as a part of its structure. In other words, a class has another class as one of its components or attributes. This relationship is often used to model complex objects by combining simpler objects, promoting code reuse, flexibility, and modularity. The \"has-a\" relationship is a key aspect of composition in object-oriented programming.\n",

        "Composition is a design principle where objects of one class are combined or composed with objects of another class.\n",

        "Code Reusability:\n",

        "Composition promotes code reusability by allowing the reuse of existing classes as components in the construction of new classes.\n",
        "Components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, contributing to a more modular and reusable codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility and Modularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"has-a\" relationship provides flexibility in designing and assembling objects at runtime.\n",
        "It supports a modular design where changes to one component do not necessarily affect the entire system, enhancing maintainability and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is maintained in composition, as each class is responsible for its own functionality.\n",

        "Composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs by promoting a design approach that allows for building complex systems from simpler, independent components. Here are key ways in which composition contributes to these aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition encourages a modular design where a system is broken down into smaller, self-contained components. Each component is responsible for a specific functionality or aspect of the system.\n",
        "Modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, making the codebase more manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Components created through composition can be reused in different contexts or in multiple parts of the program. This reduces redundancy and promotes the reuse of well-tested and reliable code.\n",
        "Reusable components contribute to a more efficient and maintainable codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition supports encapsulation, as each component is responsible for its own implementation details. The internal workings of a component are hidden from the external code, reducing dependencies.\n",
        "Changes to the internal implementation of one component do not necessarily affect the entire system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clearer Separation of Concerns:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition allows for a clearer separation of concerns, where each component has a specific responsibility or functionality. This separation makes it easier to understand, modify, and extend the code.\n",
        "Changes in one component are less likely to impact other components, leading to a more maintainable system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility and Adaptability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Components can be easily replaced or extended without affecting the entire system. This flexibility is crucial when adapting the code to changing requirements or integrating new features.\n",
        "It promotes an adaptable design that can evolve over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Testing and Debugging:\n",
        "\n",
        "Independent components are easier to test in isolation. Unit testing can be applied to individual components, ensuring that each part of the system functions as expected.\n",
        "Debugging is more straightforward since issues can often be traced to a specific component, and changes can be localized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduced Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Breaking down a complex system into smaller components reduces the overall complexity of the code. It becomes easier to understand, maintain, and reason about the behavior of the system.\n",
        "Each component can be designed to have a well-defined interface, simplifying the interaction between components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition supports scalability, allowing the addition of new features or components without disrupting existing functionality. This is particularly beneficial for large and evolving software projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Promotion of Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition encourages the use of best practices such as dependency injection, inversion of control, and design patterns. These practices contribute to cleaner, more maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Readability and Documentation:\n",
        "\n",
